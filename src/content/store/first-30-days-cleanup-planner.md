## What it is
A 30-day sequence that turns “I need cleanup” into an ordered plan, with guardrails to avoid wasted work.

## What you get
- A structured sequence: **Recon → Stabilize → Verify → Handoff**
- A built-in **exceptions log** (don’t guess; don’t rely on memory)
- A progress view so you know what to do next

## Who it’s for
DIY cleanup or prep before hiring help.

## Not for
One-click automation or instant “fixed books.”
