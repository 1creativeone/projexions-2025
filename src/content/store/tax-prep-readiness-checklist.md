## What This Is

A short, practical checklist that helps you gather the information and documentation most CPAs expect **before** they begin tax preparation.

It is designed to reduce avoidable back-and-forth, last-minute surprises, and delays caused by missing records.

## What It Covers

- Bank + credit card statements and reconciliation signals
- Income support (including platform payouts when relevant)
- Expense documentation expectations
- Payroll and contractor items (when applicable)
- Sales tax and other “usually forgotten” items
- Access and handoff basics (what your CPA will ask for)

## When It’s Useful

- You’re preparing for tax filing and want to avoid chaos
- You’re working with a CPA or accountant for the first time
- Your bookkeeping is “mostly fine,” but you’re not confident it’s review-ready
- You want a clean, repeatable checklist you can use every year

## What It Is Not

This checklist is not accounting or tax advice, and it does not replace a CPA. It is an organizational reference designed to help you prepare records for professional review.

## Delivery
