## What it is
A simple diagnostic that estimates cleanup scope (Low / Moderate / High / Complex) based on reconciliation gaps, volume, platforms, documentation, and risk factors.

## What you get
- A **0–100 score** and a clear tier result
- The **top blockers** driving complexity
- A realistic effort range so you can plan

## Who it’s for
Business owners who are behind and want clarity before tax season, CPA handoff, or cleanup work.

## Not for
Anyone looking for tax advice, deductions, or “hacks.”
