        <h2 class="section-title text-center">What Projexions Does</h2>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Projexions helps small businesses get bookkeeping records cleaned up, organized, and maintained—whether that means catching up on a backlog or keeping books in order month to month.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-12">
          This includes reconciling accounts, sorting out payment processor records, categorizing expenses, and getting everything into a state where it's ready for tax filing, CPA review, or ongoing reporting.
        </p>
