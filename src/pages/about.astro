        <h2 class="section-title text-center">What Projexions Does</h2>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Projexions helps small businesses get bookkeeping records cleaned up, organized, and ready for tax filing or CPA review.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-12">
          This usually means catching up on months (or years) of neglected books, reconciling accounts, sorting out payment processor records, and getting everything into a state where someone else can actually use it.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title text-center">Who Projexions Works With</h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Projexions primarily works with small businesses in West Hollywood and the surrounding area—though location matters less than fit.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">Typical clients include:</p>

        <ul class="resource-list text-lg mb-12">
          <li>Solo founders and independent operators</li>
          <li>E-commerce sellers using Shopify, Stripe, or other platforms</li>
          <li>Small agencies with inconsistent or neglected records</li>
          <li>Businesses approaching tax season without confidence in their books</li>
        </ul>

        <hr class="section-divider">

        <h2 class="section-title text-center">Background</h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Projexions has operated for 11 years, providing bookkeeping cleanup and organizational support to businesses that need records fixed—not managed indefinitely.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-12">
          The focus has always been practical: get books into a usable state, hand them off properly, and move on.
        </p>

        <hr class="section-divider">

        <h2 class="section-title text-center">Scope of Work</h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Projexions provides bookkeeping cleanup and organization—not professional advice.
        </p>

        <ul class="resource-list text-lg mb-6">

          <li>No audits or formal accounting opinions</li>

        </ul>
