        <h2 class="section-title text-center">Financial Structure When Records Matter</h2>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Projexions exists to address a recurring reality across businesses of all sizes: financial records are often left unattended until clarity becomes unavoidable.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          That moment usually arrives during tax filing, professional review, financing discussions, operational transitions, or other situations where accuracy and documentation suddenly matter. By then, time is limited and decisions are constrained.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-12">
          Projexions focuses on the period <em>before</em> and <em>around</em> those moments—bringing structure, clarity, and usable information back into focus.
        </p>

        <hr class="section-divider">

        <h2 class="section-title text-center">How the Approach Was Formed</h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Projexions was built around a simple observation: most financial problems are not technical. They are structural.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Over time, the same patterns appear repeatedly—records that fall out of sync, systems that no longer reflect reality, documentation that exists but cannot be reviewed with confidence. These issues rarely disrupt day-to-day operations. They surface only when records are relied upon externally or questioned under pressure.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          That perspective comes from years of working inside real businesses and operating alongside accounting and tax professionals, where the cost of unclear records is measured not just in time, but in missed opportunities and constrained decisions.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-12">
          The goal here is not perfection. It is usable, defensible financial information when it actually matters.
        </p>

        <hr class="section-divider">

        <h2 class="section-title text-center">Systems Before Services</h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Projexions is intentionally systems-first.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Hands-on services can correct problems after they appear. Systems reduce how often those problems arise in the first place.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          For that reason, Projexions develops tools, templates, and reference materials designed to help businesses:
        </p>
        <ul class="resource-list text-lg mb-6">
          <li>Understand the condition of their records</li>
          <li>Identify gaps before deadlines force action</li>
          <li>Restore structure after growth, transition, or neglect</li>
          <li>Prepare records for professional review with less friction</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-12">
          Services are available when intervention is necessary, but they are not the starting point by default.
        </p>

        <hr class="section-divider">

        <h2 class="section-title text-center">What Makes Projexions Different</h2>
        <ul class="resource-list text-lg mb-12">
          <li>Focus on organization and readiness, not advice</li>
          <li>Designed for operators, not accounting departments</li>
          <li>Software-aware, including modern platforms and payment systems</li>
          <li>Structured to support judgment, not replace it</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-12">
          This work sits between day-to-day operations and formal professional services, helping businesses bridge that gap intentionally.
        </p>

        <hr class="section-divider">

        <h2 class="section-title text-center">Scope and Boundaries</h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Projexions does not provide accounting advice, tax advice, legal advice, or financial advice.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          No tax filings, representations, compliance opinions, or determinations are made. Tools and consulting are limited to organization, systems, and decision-support.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-12">
          When professional advice or filing is required, businesses should engage licensed professionals directly.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-12">
          Clear boundaries are part of building reliable systems.
        </p>

        <hr class="section-divider">

        <h2 class="section-title text-center">Moving Forward</h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
          Whether through self-guided tools or limited hands-on support, Projexions exists to help businesses regain clarity before it becomes urgent—or restore it when that point has already passed.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed font-medium text-center closing-statement">
          Accuracy matters most when it can no longer be deferred.
