        <h2 class="section-title text-center">Tax Season Exposes What's Been Easy to Ignore</h2>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          When records fall behind, it's rarely obvious until something forces the issue. Tax filing is usually that moment.

        <h2 class="section-title text-center">What This Looks Like</h2>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">Most cleanup engagements involve some combination of:</p>

        <ul class="resource-list text-lg mb-6">
          <li>Reconciling bank and credit card accounts</li>
          <li>Sorting out payment processor records (Stripe, Square, PayPal)</li>
          <li>Cleaning up Shopify and e-commerce platform records</li>
          <li>Organizing expenses and categorization</li>
          <li>Clearing the backlog so a CPA can actually file</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-12">
          Scope depends on how far behind things are and what's actually needed. Some cleanups take days. Others take longer. One recent engagement: a full year reconciled in 12 hours.
        </p>

        <hr class="section-divider">

        <h2 class="section-title text-center">Who This Is For</h2>
