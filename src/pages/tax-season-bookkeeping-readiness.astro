          When tax season approaches, many businesses realize their bookkeeping isn't as clean as they thought.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-12">
          This service exists to answer one question clearly:
        </p>

        <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-12 font-semibold text-center">
          What actually needs to be fixed before a CPA can file — and what can wait?
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title text-center">What This Is</h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          A one-time, tax-season review for businesses that are behind, unsure, or stuck.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">You'll receive:</p>
        <ul class="resource-list text-lg mb-6">
          <li>A 60-minute, structured bookkeeping review call</li>
          <li>A written <strong>Tax Readiness Map (PDF)</strong> you can actually use</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-12">
          No cleanup. No filing. No pressure.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title text-center">Who This Is For</h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">This service is designed for:</p>
        <ul class="resource-list text-lg mb-6">
          <li>Solo founders, creators, ecommerce operators, and small agencies</li>
          <li>Businesses using QuickBooks or a similar bookkeeping system</li>
          <li>Operators unsure whether their records are usable for tax filing</li>
          <li>Anyone trying to avoid wasted time or money before engaging a CPA</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-12">
          This is <strong>not</strong> for businesses seeking ongoing bookkeeping or tax advice.

        <h2 class="section-title text-center">How It Works</h2>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-center">1. 60-Minute Tax Season Bookkeeping Evaluation</h3>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">During the call, we will:</p>
        <ul class="resource-list text-lg mb-6">
          <li>Evaluate your bookkeeping system at a high level</li>
          <li>Clarify how far behind records actually are</li>
          <li>Identify common blockers that prevent tax filing</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-12">
          This is an evaluation and assessment — not cleanup or correction.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-center">2. Tax Readiness Map (Delivered Within 48 Hours)</h3>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">After the call, you will receive a concise PDF outlining:</p>
        <ul class="resource-list text-lg mb-6">
          <li>Whether your books are usable for tax filing</li>
          <li>What a CPA will require before proceeding</li>
          <li>What is blocking filing versus what can wait</li>
          <li>The realistic order of operations from here</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title text-center">What You'll Walk Away With</h2>
        <ul class="resource-list text-lg mb-12">
          <li>A clear understanding of your current record condition</li>
          <li>Reduced uncertainty before contacting a CPA</li>
          <li>A written reference for planning next steps</li>
          <li>Relief from guessing or spiraling</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-12">
          For many, this is the first time their situation feels contained and understandable.
        </p>

        <hr class="section-divider">

        <h2 class="section-title text-center">What This Is Not</h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">To be explicit:</p>
        <ul class="resource-list text-lg mb-6">
          <li>This is not bookkeeping cleanup</li>
          <li>This is not tax advice</li>
          <li>This does not include filing or representation</li>
          <li>This does not replace a CPA</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-12">
          It is clarity — before you spend more time or money.
