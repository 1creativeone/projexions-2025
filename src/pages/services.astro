        <h2 class="section-title text-center">Financial Organization, Cleanup, and Record Readiness</h2>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Projexions provides targeted financial organization and cleanup services when clarity becomes necessary.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-12">
          This is not a high-volume monthly bookkeeping practice. Services are focused on restoring usable, defensible records—typically in advance of tax filing, professional review, or operational decisions where accuracy matters.

        <h2 class="section-title text-center">Bookkeeping Services (Selective)</h2>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          In limited cases, Projexions takes on hands-on bookkeeping work following a review or cleanup phase.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">This may include:</p>
        <ul class="resource-list text-lg mb-6">
          <li>short-term cleanup or catch-up work</li>
          <li>stabilization ahead of tax filing or CPA review</li>
          <li>limited ongoing support where scope is clearly defined</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-12">
          Bookkeeping is not offered as a default or high-volume service.<br>
          Engagements are evaluated individually based on complexity, timing, and fit.

        <h2 class="section-title text-center">When Services Make Sense</h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Engagements usually begin when records can no longer be deferred.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">Common situations include:</p>
        <ul class="resource-list text-lg mb-6">

          <li>Accounts that are no longer fully reconciled</li>

          <li>Preparation for tax filing or CPA review</li>
          <li>Changes in systems, platforms, or business structure</li>
          <li>Periods of growth, transition, or neglect</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-12">
          The objective is not perfection. It is clarity that holds up under review.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title text-center">Starting With a Review</h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Many businesses are better served by understanding their situation before engaging cleanup services.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">

        </ul>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-12">
