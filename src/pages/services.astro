        <h2 class="section-title text-center">Bookkeeping Cleanup</h2>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Tax season has a way of surfacing problems that were easy to ignore. If your books are behind and a CPA can't proceed, cleanup is usually the first step.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Projexions provides hands-on bookkeeping cleanup for small businesses, agencies, and e-commerce sellers—particularly those dealing with:
        </p>

        <ul class="resource-list text-lg mb-6">
          <li>Months or years of unreconciled accounts</li>
          <li>Messy Stripe, Shopify, or payment processor records</li>
          <li>Expenses that were never properly categorized</li>
          <li>Records that need to be usable before a tax deadline</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Scope is determined individually based on how far behind things are and what's actually needed.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title text-center">Bookkeeper Hiring Help</h2>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Hiring the wrong bookkeeper leads to months of cleanup, confusion, and avoidable cost.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Projexions offers a second opinion before you make a hire—a pre-hire risk check focused on role fit and observable signals.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">This includes:</p>

        <ul class="resource-list text-lg mb-6">
          <li>Review of role context and responsibilities</li>
          <li>Review of interview notes or a recorded interview</li>
          <li>Written risk summary identifying competency signals, red flags, and areas to verify</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-center">
          <strong>Fee:</strong> $250<br>
          <strong>Delivery:</strong> 24–48 hours
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          This service does not include hiring decisions, HR advice, or guarantees. Its purpose is to reduce obvious hiring risk before a commitment is made.

        <h2 class="section-title text-center">Not Sure Where You Stand?</h2>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          For businesses that aren't sure whether they need cleanup—or can handle it themselves—Projexions offers a one-time Tax Season Readiness evaluation.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          This is a 60-minute call plus a written assessment of where things actually are, what needs attention before filing, and what can wait.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          From there, options are clear: hire Projexions for cleanup, tackle it yourself with the right tools, or hand the map to someone else.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          If you move forward with cleanup, the evaluation fee is credited toward the engagement.
        </p>
